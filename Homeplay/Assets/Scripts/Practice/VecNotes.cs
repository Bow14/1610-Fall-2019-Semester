	// Use this for initialization
	
	
	//Im watching a youtube tutorial about vector math so ill be taking notes here
	//Using 2d vectors with graphing points and such are useful when you need to have the game make predictions
	
	//Unity runs on a left hand system where you put your finger into a l shape and it will repersent z,y,x in that order
	//A Dot Product--Produces a scaler for graphing on the xyz axies = to find this we need to multiply their values 
	//and get their sum
	// unity has a built in calaculator for dot products Vector3.Dot(Vector A, Vector B)
	
	//Use Cross products to make a whole new vector = A ^ B = C have to use cross multiplication with xyz
	//Vector3.Cross(Vector A, Vector B) this is what you need to do to get unity to calculate for you
	

	// Update is called once per frame
